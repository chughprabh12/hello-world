# hello-world
first repository

Hi Humans !!

prabhsimar here, I started to code in starting of this year (2020) , a year full of problems but i have got some time to learn new things, so i learnt c and did my first code of life -"hello world" , and then i learnt c++ ; now moved on to java 8, and i am so excited to go for android now. Basically i am a student who have some knowledge in programming and joined github to improve my programming skills, my algorithms etc.
thanks for reading..
